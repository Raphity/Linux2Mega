# Linux2Mega

This program creates a backup of your home directory.
It requires a Mega account to save your backup to cloud.
You can use an external drive to have a copy of the backup locally.
Your backup is being encrypted with aes-256-ctr before being send to Mega servers.

This project is not finished. The restore file and some other features will be added soon.
